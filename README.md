## About

I'm JavaCode7 and I really like programming. My favourite language is Python as it's my best language and it's powerful.

I also really like making programming languages. I am the creator of the Thulium, Chromium and Titanium esoteric programming languages and I helped create the Beryllium esolang as well.
